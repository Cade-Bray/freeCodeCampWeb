**Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design**

I'm adding a repository so I can use this as a point of reference in the future and to show my continued intrest in different areas of development. My current experience has been mostly with OOP and databases with an emphasis on back end development.
My goal is to gain more relevant knowledge in front end development.

**What will this repository explore**

With the Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design certificate I'll be challenged with modules in general html and css. In later certifications that I intend to take as well I will be exploring incorperation of front end libraries and intergration of databases.
Eventually I want to find a full stack project for my to push my skills to the test with.
